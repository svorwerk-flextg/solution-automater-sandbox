# Solution-Automater-Sandbox Security Architecture

## Overview

This security architecture provides a bulletproof isolation framework for enterprise AI sandbox operations with absolute protection against unauthorized database writes and data exfiltration.

## Core Security Principles

1. **Zero Trust Network Architecture**: All connections are denied by default
2. **Read-Only Enforcement**: Hardware-level blocking of write operations to production/dev
3. **Complete Session Isolation**: Each AI agent runs in isolated containers with no shared state
4. **Automatic Data Destruction**: All session data is cryptographically destroyed on termination
5. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Every operation is logged with tamper-proof mechanisms

## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Connection Proxy
- Intercepts all database connections at the network level
- Enforces read-only operations through SQL parsing and protocol inspection
- Blocks INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, CREATE, ALTER commands
- Maintains connection pooling for performance

### 2. Network Security Layer
- Docker network isolation with custom bridge networks
- iptables rules for granular traffic control
- VLAN segregation for different security zones
- TLS encryption for all external connections

### 3. Session Lifecycle Manager
- Automated container provisioning and destruction
- Cryptographic erasure of all session data
- Work artifact preservation to encrypted S3
- Session timeout enforcement

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Kubernetes-style pod security policies
- Resource quotas and limits per agent
- Inter-agent communication through secure message queues
- Shared volume mounts with read-only access

### 5. Audit and Compliance
- Centralized logging with tamper protection
- Real-time alerting for security violations
- Compliance reporting for SOC2/ISO27001
- Forensic analysis capabilities
