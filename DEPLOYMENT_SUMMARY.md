## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. One-command installation
./scripts/install-solution-automater-sandbox.sh

# 2. Environment setup (guided)
./bin/sas setup

# 3. Start the platform
./bin/sas start

# 4. Access the platform
open https://localhost:8080
```

### Common Operations
```bash
# Agent management
./bin/sas agent start claude-pro my-agent
./bin/sas agent list
./bin/sas agent logs my-agent

# Database operations  
./bin/sas db connect --type mssql --env prod
./bin/sas db query "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM users"
./bin/sas db schema-sync --source prod --target sandbox

# Cloud operations
./bin/sas cloud fabric tables
./bin/sas cloud aws resources
./bin/sas cloud status

# Security operations
./bin/sas security scan
./bin/sas security audit
./bin/sas security status

# Session management
./bin/sas session new --name data-analysis
./bin/sas session continue --name data-analysis
./bin/sas session cleanup --all
```
